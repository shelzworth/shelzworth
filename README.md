ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Sheldon(@shelzworth)
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in developing applications which can be put to use by others and can see real-world application.
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently a student at Toronto Metropolitian University in my second year of computer engineering.
âš¡ Fun fact: I love Star Wars, if you ever need someone to discuss Star Wars with, reach out!
